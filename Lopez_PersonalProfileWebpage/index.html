                        <p>I am 19 years old; I live in Purok 20, Casisang, Malaybalay City, Bukidnon. I was born with a heart disease called Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA), which caused me many times to have seizures before. In the year 2021, at Northern Mindanao Medical Center, I was operated. Right now, I live happily since my seizure was not unlike in the past few years. However, there are times it triggers and still has a recovery today.</p>

                                    <p>Playing the piano is one of my skills and hobbies; as I look at myself before, I am not a fan of music; I am more attracted to another category of art, which is drawings, paintings, and charcoal sketching. There was a summer before that for me was boring because there was nothing to do. Since our home has a keyboard, I practice how to play it until I enjoy playing it.</p>

                                    <p>As I look at myself before drawing became my best friend when I was a kid. That skill and hobby sent me to the Special Program in the Arts (SPA) visual arts in junior high, where I discovered how beautiful art is.</p>

Anime series show how beautiful the art of manga artists is and the plot written by writers. Similar to Korean dramas, which introduce the beautiful stories that thrill me to watch the next episode.</p>
