                            My family is one of the things I am proud of. Ever since I was a child, they have been a concern to me every time something. Additionally, they were the ones who helped me grow mature. They also support me in those things I have liked and many more. That is why my family symbolizes a treasure in my life, and I am proud of it.

                            Graduating high school is one of the things I am proud of. At this grade level, this is where my mind gets more mature than my mindset at the elementary years level. During high school, it gives me some feelings similar to a roller coaster ride. Where I encounter disappointments and happiness, which has a moral lesson. Those moral lessons I experienced in high school enabled me to use those in my college journey.

                            During my high school journey, the band Quantum Echo that I joined also gave me happiness since this is the band where I showcased my hobbies of playing the piano or keyboard together with playing the music I am listening to.
